Still in developpement.

Filter is not working but we're close to make it.

In theory, you should be able to pic a "commune" to filter the fontaine and others, and then see in which "rue" it is.

You also have a map to the right to search it through an image of paris in 2d. Only issue on it, you can't see the exact one you want without searching it manually. We will look after it later.
